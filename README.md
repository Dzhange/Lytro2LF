# Lytro2LF

A little script to extract a raw Lytro image into multi-view images under different angle.

This code is written a long time ago, but I just found out that some one is still interested in it.
Unfortunately, I myself couldn't understand the code since I forgot the structure of my directories of data, and I also lost the template json file.

I think the only usable part of this code is the `subview.sh`, which records the right command to extract the raw image using the tool.
Also, in `generate_json.py`, some important variable names are listed.

Hope this dumped code could still help you! If you somehow magically understand the code or refined it, please send a pull request. Any help would be appreciated.
